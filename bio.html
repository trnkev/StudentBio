            Hi, my name is Kevin Tran. I am a student for the U of O Part-time Full-Stack program.
            My hobbies as of now is programming, playing guitar, and hiking. So far programming is
            going well. It's keeping me up at night, but I don't have any regrets.
            <br><br>
            I am doing this program because I want to change career. I want to do creative and
            meaningful work while building relationships with interesting people. I believe 
            this industry will open doors to work in that space. If things don't work out, at least
            I know how to code. I think it is fun. 
        </p>
